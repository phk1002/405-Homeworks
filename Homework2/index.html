<p class= "description">
  Vegetable pulao is one of the most popular dishes in India. <br/>Because of the rich flavors and colors in the vegetable pulav, both adults and kids enjoy this delicious dish. In my household, vegetable pulao is made almost every week! Usually, vegetable pulao is served with a side of raita (plain yoghurt mixed with onions and herbs) for an extra kick of flavors. </p>
